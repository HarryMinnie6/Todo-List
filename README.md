# Todo-List
A Todo-list made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

A Todo-list that stores items in the local storage. 
Items can be marked as complete and deleted once they are added to the Todo-List.

A few issues found: (needs to be fixed)
1.) When the page is refreshed items marked as complete get unchecked.
2.) Optional: Add a css effect to list item delete button (when task gets deleted Css effect happens).
